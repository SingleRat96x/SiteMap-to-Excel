Project Title:
Sitemap to XLSX Chrome Extension

Objective
Develop a Chrome extension using TypeScript that enables users to fetch, filter, and export sitemap URLs into a clean .xlsx file. The extension will provide a modern, user-friendly interface and robust functionality for managing website sitemaps.

Key Features
1. User Interface (UI):
Popup Interface:

Input field for the website or sitemap URL.
Buttons for:
"Fetch Sitemap" to retrieve URLs.
"Filter" to open filtering options.
"Download XLSX" to export URLs.
Status section to display progress or errors.
Filtering Modal:

Text field for keyword matching.
Text field for regex pattern matching.
Preview area showing filtered results in a scrollable list.
Buttons for:
Apply Filter to refine URLs.
Clear Filter to reset.
Modern Design:

Use Material Design principles for responsiveness and usability.
Incorporate animations for transitions and feedback (e.g., loading spinners).
Core Functionalities
1. Fetch Sitemap URLs:
Accept both website and sitemap URLs as input.
If a generic website URL is provided:
Attempt to auto-detect and fetch /sitemap.xml.
Parse the sitemap data to extract all URLs.
Handle both XML and gzipped sitemap formats.
2. Filter URLs:
Allow users to refine URLs based on:
Keyword Matching: Match URLs containing user-specified keywords.
Regex Matching: Use regex patterns for advanced filtering.
Display real-time previews of filtered URLs.
3. Export to XLSX:
Enable exporting:
All URLs.
Filtered URLs.
Generate a well-formatted .xlsx file with URLs in a single column.
4. Error Handling:
Provide clear error messages for:
Invalid URL input.
Incorrect or poorly formatted sitemaps.
Network failures or timeout.
Invalid regex patterns.
5. Download Management:
Show a progress indicator for large sitemap downloads.
Confirm when the download is complete.
Technical Requirements
Frontend:
TypeScript for logic and UI interactions.
Material Design or TailwindCSS for modern, responsive styling.
HTML/CSS for popup and modal components.
Backend:
Sitemap Parsing:
Use a library to parse XML or gzipped sitemaps efficiently.
Filtering:
Implement keyword and regex filtering with robust validation.
File Export:
Use a library for generating .xlsx files in the browser.
Chrome Extension API:
downloads API: Manage downloading the .xlsx file.
activeTab API: Interact with the current tab to fetch sitemaps.
Permissions:
Allow access to the necessary permissions for downloads and URL validation.
Error Resilience:
Implement try-catch logic to handle and report errors gracefully.
Ensure smooth handling of large sitemaps (10,000+ URLs).
Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Efficiently handle sitemaps with tens of thousands of URLs.
Minimize memory usage during filtering and file generation.
Compatibility:

Fully functional on the latest version of Chrome.
Cross-platform support for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
UI/UX:

Intuitive, modern, and responsive design.
Provide clear user feedback during all operations.
Security:

Validate user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
Use secure methods to handle URL fetching and processing.
Work Items
Frontend Development:
Design and implement the popup interface.
Build the filtering modal with real-time preview functionality.
Integrate Material Design or TailwindCSS for styling.
Backend Development:
Implement sitemap fetching logic.
Parse and process sitemap URLs.
Develop URL filtering mechanisms.
Create .xlsx file generation functionality.
Integration:
Connect the popup UI to backend functionalities.
Handle real-time feedback between the UI and backend processes.
Testing:
Validate proper functioning with various sitemap formats.
Test filtering with both keywords and regex.
Ensure .xlsx files are correctly generated and downloaded.
Handle edge cases, such as invalid inputs or network issues.
Deployment:
Package the extension as a Chrome Web Extension.
Test the extension on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Submit the extension to the Chrome Web Store with all required metadata and documentation.
